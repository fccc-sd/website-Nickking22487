    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first goal is to take my drivers test to get my permit, to later on get my drivers license.
        My next goal is to find a job that I like and can get to.<br> Eventualy I hope to get married to a lovingly wife and make a happy family.
        Another goal I want to complete is to learn how to play the guitar, the drums, and  a paino. I would also like to get back into gaming again as who dosen't like to play a game from time to time.<br>
