        <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in NW Ohio and has lived here
     most of my life so far. I like to read quit often, and space 
     out thinking about how I'd of taken the book in different directions
     or further a thing the characters had done. <br>I only ever went to Bryan based schools until now.
     I don't really have many friends do to the way I see a friendship as more of an aquintance.
     Altough not really a color my favorit color is black.
     I didn't like reading when I was young cause books would fall into three catagouries. <br>1.They were all non-fiction books.
     <br>2.They were books that were to childish for me to really get into. <br>3.They were all fictional slic of life type books like
     <em>Dirary of the Wimmppy Kid</em> or they were to big for me to read.
     Eventualy I found a book seires that I liked and found others like it, thus starting my like of books.
