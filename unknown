            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in NW Ohio and has lived here
                most of my life so far. I like to read quit often, and space 
                out thinking about how I'd of taken the book in different directions
                or further a thing the characters had done. <br>I only ever went to Bryan based schools until now.
                I don't really have many friends do to the way I see a friendship as more of an aquintance.
                Altough not really a color my favorit color is black.
                I didn't like reading when I was young cause books would fall into three catagouries. <br>1.They were all non-fiction books.
                <br>2.They were books that were to childish for me to really get into. <br>3.They were all fictional slic of life type books like
                <em>Dirary of the Wimmppy Kid</em> or they were to big for me to read.
                Eventualy I found a book seires that I liked and found others like it, thus starting my like of books.
